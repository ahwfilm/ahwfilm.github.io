# Hi, I'm Alex White! 

I'm studying Media Arts and Design at James Madison University with a concentration in Digital Video & Cinema and a Creative Writing minor.

I am an aspiring Storyteller and visual strategist looking to strengthen my command of the full creative process, from narrative development to final-cut and data distribution.

## About Me

**Skills Include:**
- **Cinematography and Graphic Design:** Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign
- **Digital Marketing:** Campaign Strategy, Social Media Content Creation, and Analytics

This past semester I was Social Media Chair Head for Phi Gamma Nu, a professional development organization at JMU, attracting over 300 potential new members through targeted campaigns.

My career goal is to lead a team of artists through compelling, creative visions that are both visually stunning and drives action for critical causes.

I am passionate about purpose-driven work and working with my community.
